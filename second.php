    2.Write a program which will give you all of the combinations of 3 digits, printed in a comma delimited format.


    3.Write a PHP script that creates the following table (use for loops):1234567891024681012141618203691215182124273048121620242832364051015202530354045506121824303642485460714212835424956637081624324048566472809182736455463728190102030405060708090100

    4.Write a program which will print all primary numbers in the range of 1 to 100.
    
    5.Write a program that will execute the bubble sort algorithm for the given one-dimensional array.
    
    6.Write a PHP script to calculate and display average temperature, five lowest and highest temperatures.Recorded temperatures : 78, 60, 62, 68, 71, 68, 73, 85, 66, 64, 76, 63, 75, 76, 73, 68, 62, 73, 72, 65, 74, 62, 62, 65, 64, 68, 73, 75, 79, 73
    
    7.Write a program which will remove element on given position from given one dimensional array 
    (remember about indexing items).
    
    8.Write a program which will create one dimensional array from two given arrays (donâ€™t use predefined function, only for loops).
    
    9.Write a program that will implement the matrix addition algorithm (remember about validation).
    
    10.Write a program that will implement the matrix multiplicationalgorithm (remember about validation).     -->
